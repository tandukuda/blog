I'm **tandukuda**, a graphic designer and 3D artist who creates visuals with intent—clear, structured, and expressive, whether static or in motion. My work sits at the intersection of design, motion, and systems, driven by an obsession with structure, mood, and efficiency. Whether it's brand visuals, 3D scenes, or motion work, I care less about trends and more about making things feel deliberate and functional.

Outside client work, I build tools to optimize my workflow—lightweight web and CLI apps like [LiteQR](https://liteqr.vercel.app/), [ChromaLab](https://chroma-lab.vercel.app/), [Halfline](https://halfline.tandukuda.xyz/), and [SceneShift](https://github.com/tandukuda/SceneShift/), plus a small design system like the [Rose Pine theme for OneCommander](https://github.com/rose-pine/onecommander). Each project starts from a specific pain point or inefficiency in my daily work, motivating me to develop practical experiments in visual logic, system design, and problem-solving, built for my own needs.
