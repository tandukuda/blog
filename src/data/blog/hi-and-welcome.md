## Welcome
My name is **tandukuda**. I am a graphic designer and 3d artist who loves computers. I built this blog to document my process of learning and building my (future) projects. Currently, I have developed several apps and web applications. You can find them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/tandukuda). My latest and most ambitious project is [SceneShift](https://github.com/tandukuda/SceneShift).

SceneShift is a TUI tool. It lets you kill or suspend apps of your choice. It has zero bloatware, because I hate it so much. Everything runs offline on your machine. No information will be stored on the server, and I don’t have it either.

With my background as a graphic designer and 3d artist, learning coding is not an easy task. I have to admit that most of my project is me just vibe-coding with the help of different AI models. I know it’s not a good move, but with that, I have to learn the language. For instance, when I build [LiteQR](https://liteqr.vercel.app/). I have learned JavaScript in order to get the QR to work as I intended. Right now, while I’m building and improving SceneShift, I learn [Golang](https://go.dev/). For me, Go is quite easy to learn for beginners like me and has high performance with its built-in concurrency model.

So, I will update this blog monthly for right now. Because I don’t want to make a short blog post that has nothing in it.

Thank you,
tandukuda.
